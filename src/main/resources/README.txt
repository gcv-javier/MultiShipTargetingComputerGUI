The application doesn't need admin privileges.
To launch the application double click on the .exe file.
The lib folder would be needed in the same directory as the .exe file,
if you didn't have Java installed in your system (the compiling version used was 1.17.0).
If you don't have Java installed, do not move the .exe file apart from lib folder.
